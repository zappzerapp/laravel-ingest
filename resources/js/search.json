[[{"l":"Introduction to Laravel Ingest","p":["Laravel Ingest revolutionizes the way Laravel applications import data. We end the chaos of custom, error-prone import scripts and provide an elegant, declarative, and robust framework for defining complex data import processes.","The system handles the \"dirty\" work—file processing, streaming, validation, background jobs, error reporting, and API provision—so you can focus on the business logic."]},{"l":"The Core Problem We Solve","p":["Importing data (CSV, Excel, etc.) is often a painful process: repetitive code, lack of robustness with large files, poor user experience, and inadequate error handling. Laravel Ingest solves this with a declarative, configuration-driven approach."]},{"l":"Key Features","p":["Limitless Scalability: By consistently utilizing streams and queues, there is no limit to file size. Whether 100 rows or 10 million, memory usage remains consistently low.","Fluent & Expressive API: Define imports in a readable and self-explanatory way using the IngestConfig class.","Source Agnostic: Import from file uploads, (S)FTP servers, URLs, or any Laravel filesystem disk ( s3, local). Easily extensible for other sources.","Robust Background Processing: Uses the Laravel Queue by default for maximum reliability.","Comprehensive Mapping & Validation: Transform data on-the-fly, resolve relationships, and use the validation rules of your Eloquent models.","Auto-generated API & CLI: Control and monitor imports via RESTful endpoints or the included Artisan commands.","\"Dry Runs\": Simulate an import to detect validation errors without writing a single database entry."]}],[{"l":"Installation","p":["Getting started with Laravel Ingest is simple. Follow these steps to integrate the package into your project."]},{"l":"1. Require with Composer","p":["First, add the package to your project's dependencies using Composer:"]},{"l":"2. Publish Assets","p":["Next, publish the configuration file and database migrations. This will create config/ingest.php and the necessary migration files in database/migrations/.","You can choose to publish only the configuration or the migrations by using the tags ingest-config or ingest-migrations."]},{"l":"3. Run Migrations","p":["Run the database migrations to create the ingest_runs and ingest_rows tables. These tables are essential for tracking the status and results of your imports.","That's it! Laravel Ingest is now installed and ready to be configured."]}],[{"l":"Your First Importer","p":["Let's create a simple importer to understand the core concepts of Laravel Ingest. We will build an importer for a User model."]},{"l":"1. Define the Importer Class","p":["An importer is a simple PHP class that implements the IngestDefinition interface. This interface has a single method, getConfig(), which returns an IngestConfig object. This object declaratively defines the entire import process.","Create a new file at app/Ingest/UserImporter.php:","This configuration tells Laravel Ingest to:","Import data into the User model.","Expect a file UPLOAD as the source.","Use the email column to identify unique records.","If a user with the same email already exists, UPDATE their record.","Map the CSV column full_name to the name attribute on the model.","Map user_email to email.","Map is_admin to is_admin, transforming the value \"yes\" into a boolean.","Use validation rules defined on the User model."]},{"l":"2. Register the Importer","p":["To make your importer discoverable by the framework, you need to \"tag\" it in a service provider. The AppServiceProvider is a great place for this.","Laravel Ingest automatically generates a URL-friendly \"slug\" from the class name. UserImporter becomes user-importer."]},{"l":"3.
